#Creating Fake Data Sets To Explore Hypotheses

```plaintext

spema <- sample(26:80,20, replace = TRUE)
spele <- sample(24:30, 12, replace = TRUE)

#spema follows the random distribution of species 1 skull size
# The lowest skull size is 26 while the highest it can be is 80. There are 20 specimens
#spele follows the random distribution of species 2 skull size
# The lowest skull size is 10 while the highest it can be is 32. There are 20 specimens
```

###ANOVA TEST
```plaintext
ANOVA_HM2 <- aov(spema~spele)
summary(ANOVA_HM2)

# here is the code that assigns the anova test to the variable ANOVA_HM2
```   
###For Loop Function
```plaintext
m <- c(80,85,90,95,100)
for (i in 1:length(m)) {
  spema <- sample(26:m[i],200, replace = TRUE)
  ANOVA_HM2 <- aov(spema~spele)
  x <- summary(ANOVA_HM2)
  print(m[i])
  print(x[[1]]$`Pr(>F)`)
}
# m is used to store the loops of the increasing value
# The for loop stars with the length of m, every time it loops the value of my spema's higher end is increased by 5 mm every loop.
# After the loop is calculated the value that is changed is printed followed by the anova test value. This loop continues until it hits the final length of m
```
