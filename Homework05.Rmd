## Problems
#### Q1
```plaintext
n_dims <- sample(3:10,1,replace = TRUE)
# single random integer between 3 and 10
# different function for integer values, whole numbers
# replace true means re sample it the number changes

n_dims2 <- 1:n_dims^2
# create a vector of consecutive integers from 1 to n_dims^2


n_dims3 <- sample(x=n_dims2)
# use sample function to randomly reshuffle values

m <- matrix(data=n_dims3,nrow=)
# create a square matrix with these elements

print(m)
# print out the matrix
# Notes: 

tmatrix <- t(m)
# find a function in r to transpose matrix

print(tmatrix)
# print it out again and note how it has changed


x1 <- 
y1 <-
# Sum and mean of 1st row

x2 <-
y2 <-
# Sum and mean of last row
# calculate the sum and the mean of the elements in 1st and last row


p <-
# eigen() function in matrix


v <-
# $values and $vectors in output
# kind of number: 


t <-
# typeof() function to figure out type
```



#### Q2   
```plaintext

my_matrix <- matrix(runif(16), nrow = 4)
# my_matrix



#my_logical

#my_letters

#newList
#typeof()
#combine
#data type?


```


#### Q3   
```plaintext

#my_units

#my_letters

#first variable
```
