### Problem 01   


x <- 1.1  
a <- 2.2  
b <- 3.3  


$$ \text{y <- (x^a^b)} $$
$$ \text{w <- ((x^a)^b)} $$
$$ \text{m <- (3*x^3 + 2*x^2 + 1)} $$


z <- c(y,w,m)


##### Notes:


We have our variables x, a, and b, being assigned various numbers.  
Next we have y,w, and m being assigned equations.  
Finally z has all the previous expression stored in it.  


### Problem 02

##### Part A   
prob <- c(seq(1:8), seq(from=7, to=1))


##### Part B
test <- c(1:5)   
rep(x=test,times=test)

##### Part C


new <- seq(from=5, to=1)   
test2 <- c(5:1)   
rep(x=new,times=test)
