### Problem 01   


x <- 1.1  
a <- 2.2  
b <- 3.3  


$$ \text{y <- (x^a^b)} $$
$$ \text{w <- ((x^a)^b)} $$
$$ \text{m <- (3*x^3 + 2*x^2 + 1)} $$


z <- c(y,w,m)


##### Notes:


We have our variables x, a, and b, being assigned various numbers.  
Next we have y,w, and m being assigned equations.  
Finally z has all the previous expression stored in it.  


### Problem 02

##### Part A   
prob <- c(seq(1:8), seq(from=7, to=1))


##### Part B
test <- c(1:5)   
rep(x=test,times=test)

##### Part C


new <- seq(from=5, to=1)   
test2 <- c(5:1)   
rep(x=new,times=test)   


##### Notes:
Code for part A,B,C work to produce the expected outputs for the Second part of the assignment in Homework 4


### Problem 03


numberx <- runif(1)   
numbery <- runif(1)   
r <- sqrt(numberx^2 + numbery^2)   
zero <- atan(numberx/numbery)   

final <- c(r, zero)

##### Notes:
For problem three this program generates two random numbers for the x and y coordinates respectively. Then the r and the zero are calculated to properly use the polar coordinates.

### Problem 04

queue <- c("Sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant")   


queue <- append(queue,"Serpent") #A   
queue <- (queue[! queue%in% c("Sheep")]) #B   
queue <- append(queue, "Donkey", 0) #C   
queue <- (queue[! queue%in% c("Serpent")]) #D   
queue <- (queue[! queue%in% c("owl")]) #E   
queue <- append(queue, "Aphid", after = which(queue == "ant")) #F   
ap <- which(queue == "Aphid") #G.   


##### Notes:   
The queue contains our original animal line while each step from a-g has its own queue line. Each line at the end has the # letter that corresponds with the step its solving.


### Problem 05

Rnumbers <- c(1:100)   

Rvect <- which(Rnumbers %%2 !=0 & Rnumbers %%3 !=0 & Rnumbers%%7 !=0)

##### Notes:   
Rnumbers is used to call the 1-100 list of numbers. It is then called into Rvect which checks to make sure that only numbers not divisible by 2,3, and 7 can be added to Rvect.
